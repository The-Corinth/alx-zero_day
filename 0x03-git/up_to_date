In your repository, browse to the file you want to edit.
In the upper right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.
On the Edit file tab, make any changes you need to the file.
Above the new content, click Preview changes.
At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message.
Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch.
If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.
